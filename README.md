# Whitecarrot.io - Software Developer Intern Assignment

I have created a full-stack application leveraging the Google Calendar API to fetch all events from a user's Google Calendar. It enables users to apply various filters to their events, create new events directly within the app, and download all event data as a CSV file.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCss, Shadcn-ui

**Backend:**: Node.js, Prisma, MongoDb

**Authentication:**: Next-auth

**Deployment:** Vercel


## Tech Stack and Design Choices:

I chose Next.js for its dynamic routing capabilities and server-side rendering, which enhance performance and scalability. Additionally, I used TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve code readability. For the component library, I opted for Shadcn-UI to accelerate UI development with accessible and customizable components. Next-auth, combined with JWT, was implemented to manage user sessions, with the token being utilized to make API calls to the Google Calendar API.
